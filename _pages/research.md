**Smarter Makes Greener? The Carbon Reduction Effect of Smart Manufacturing in Chinese Listed Firms.**  
[<a href="#/" onclick="visib('RevPref')">click for abstract</a>]

<div id="RevPref" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2">
	With the increasing severity of climate impact and industrial carbon regulation,
 manufacturing firms face significant challenges in carbon reduction issues. In this
 study, we employ the firm-level data from Chinese listed manufacturing companies
 between 2011 and 2019, methodically examine the impact of smart manufacturing on
 firm's carbon reduction from both theoretical and empirical vantages. The results
 indicate that: (ⅰ) Smart manufacturing has significantly reduced carbon emissions in
 firms, which remain robust even after conducting various technical tests; (ⅱ) Smart
 manufacturing can reduce firm's carbon emissions due to the technological innovation
 effect, control optimization effect, and digital-intelligence synergy effect; (ⅲ) The carbon
 reduction efficacy of smart manufacturing is found to vary, influenced by the
 heterogeneous characteristics of cities, industries, and firm-types. We for the first time
 delineates the influence and distinct transmission mechanisms by which smart
 manufacturing affects carbon reduction at the micro firm-level within the manufacturing
 industries. It not only provides significant policy insights for China's green and high
quality industrial development, but also offers valuable evidence for global community
 and manufacturing firms grappling with the ecological challenges of carbon emissions.
