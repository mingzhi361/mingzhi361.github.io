I am a MA student in Economics at [Hunan University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B9%96%E5%8D%97%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/179157 "湖南大学"). My interests are primarily in regional and environmental economics. I also enjoy from coding, kpop, and basketball. More info in my [CV](files/mingzhi361-CV.pdf "个人简历").

Recently, I have been involved in how to apply Machine Learning ([ML](https://www.zhihu.com/question/37870042])) techniques to economics research.
