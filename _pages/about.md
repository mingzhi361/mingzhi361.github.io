I am a MA student in Economics at [Hunan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan_University#General_Rankings "湖南大学"). My interests are primarily in regional and environmental economics. Meanwhile, I also enjoy from coding, kpop, and basketball. Please see my [CV](files/mingzhi361-CV.pdf "个人简历").

Recently, I have been actively learning how to apply Machine Learning ([ML](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/athey2018.pdf)) techniques in my empirical research.
