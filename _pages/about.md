I am a MA student in Economics at [Hunan University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B9%96%E5%8D%97%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/179157 "湖南大学"). My interests are primarily in regional and environmental economics. In my spare time, I pretty enjoy from coding, kpop, and basketball. See more info in my [CV](files/mingzhi361-CV.pdf "个人简历").

Recently, I have been trying how to use Machine Learning ([ML](https://www.zhihu.com/question/37870042])) methods in economic research. And I'm also working hard to learn and share computer and statistical knowledges from [GitHub](https://github.com/).
