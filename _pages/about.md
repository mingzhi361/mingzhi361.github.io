I am a MA student in Economics at [Hunan University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B9%96%E5%8D%97%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/179157 "湖南大学"). My 
research interests are primarily in regional and environmental economics. In my spare time, I pretty enjoy coding, kpop, and basketball. I'm a big Taeyeon fan for sure. More info see [my CV](/files/Mingzhi_CV.pdf "个人简历"). 

Recently, I have been working hard to learn Dynamic Quantitative Spatial Model ([see DQSM.pdf](/files/DQSM_mingzhi.pdf "动态量化空间模型")) and am committed to applying it to the research of regional economic practices in China. Meanwhile, I'm 
self-learning Julia at [GitHub](https://github.com/wenddymacro/-julia-/blob/main/Ch1Julia%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D.ipynb).
