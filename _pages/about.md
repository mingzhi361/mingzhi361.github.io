I am a MA student in Economics at [Hunan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan_University#General_Rankings "湖南大学"). My interests are primarily in regional and environmental economics. Please see my [CV](files/mingzhi361-CV.pdf).

Recently, I have been actively learning to apply machine learning techniques to my empirical research.
