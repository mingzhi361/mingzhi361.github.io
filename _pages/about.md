I am a MA student in Economics at [Hunan University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B9%96%E5%8D%97%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/179157 "湖南大学"). My 
research interests are primarily in regional and environmental economics. In my spare time, I pretty enjoy coding, kpop, and basketball. I'm a big Taeyeon fan for sure. More info see [my CV](/files/mingzhi_zhong_cv.pdf "个人简历"). 

Recently, I have been trying how to use Machine Learning ([ML](https://www.zhihu.com/question/37870042])) methods in economic research. And I'm study algorithms and statistics at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
